"""Physical-damping wall for the SCETlib-AD param model.

Port of ``wremnants/postprocessing/scetlib_np/np_damping_wall.py`` (the
continuous-lambda btgrid model) to :class:`SCETlibADParamModel`. Same rabbit
``Regularizer`` mechanism and same hinge-loss (relu^2) walls; what changed is
where the wall gets its inputs, and that is the whole content of this file --
see "The two adaptations" below.

WHY A WALL. A wrong-sign lambda anti-damps the NP form factors: the tanh
argument goes negative, so gamma_nu^NP turns POSITIVE and f^NP GROWS with b_T
instead of decaying. The b_T integral then oscillates and the differential
sigma(qT) can go negative -- a genuinely unphysical region of parameter space,
not merely a disfavoured one. The fit does not see it as unphysical: the
qT -> ptVGen rebin averages the negative differential cross section away, and
the reco fold plus the softplus ratio floor (``response.RATIO_FLOOR_SCALE``)
keep the yields, the NLL and its gradient perfectly finite. So the minimiser
will walk into it if the data pull that way, and it did -- the 2026-09-10
blinded data fit landed at lambda2_nu = -0.058 physical, so the CS kernel
ANTI-DAMPS for every b_T below 1.04 GeV^-1
(studies/scetlib-ad-param-model/260910-blinding, and 260910-wall-port for the
condition-by-condition read). Its lambda4 = -0.0027 is NOT a violation on its
own -- see the arctanh-correction note below -- and the TMD side fails only
marginally, and only in the outermost rapidity bin. This regularizer is the
fit-time penalty that keeps the lambdas in the damping region.

Wall hardness is set at fit time by rabbit's ``--regularizationStrength``
(the penalty times ``exp(2*tau)`` in ``fitter.py``; ``tau`` is a fixed
multiplier, NOT a minimised parameter). A large strength makes this a BARRIER:
~0 inside the physical region, steeply rising outside. Free (unwalled) vs
walled Delta(loss) is then the data-model tension diagnostic -- railing against
a wall at large Delta(loss) is genuine tension, not a masked pathology.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The two adaptations (both silently break a naive port)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. THE FITTED LAMBDAS ARE UNIT NUISANCES, NOT PHYSICAL LAMBDAS. Commit
   8f6af64f reparametrised every fitted parameter as ``physical = anchor +
   width * theta`` (``params.REPARAM``, kind ``"unit"``), and rabbit's
   ``Regularizer`` is handed ``get_x()`` (``fitter.py`` ``_compute_nll_components``),
   i.e. THETA. A wall written against physical lambdas and applied to theta is
   simply wrong -- for this cache theta = 0 is lambda2 = 0.4, not 0. So the
   wall maps theta -> physical itself, from ``params.REPARAM`` (the width) and
   the correction's own runcard (the anchor). Nothing is hardcoded here.

2. THERE IS NO ``indata.scetlib_np_param_model``. The old wall read the NP
   forms and the lambda order off the model, which published itself on the
   shared ``indata``. ``SCETlibADParamModel`` does not, so this wall derives
   everything from the same artefacts the model does:

     the NP forms   the recorded theory-correction runcard
                    (``response.corr_config_from_meta`` ->
                    ``Nonperturbative.np_model`` / ``np_model_nu``), which is
                    also what ``params.CORR_REFUSE_KEYS`` refuses a cache
                    mismatch on, so the form the wall reads is the form the
                    calculation computes.
     the anchors    ``params.corr_anchor_value`` on that same config -- the
                    model's own ``anchor_source="correction"`` default.
     the lambda positions
                    resolved BY NAME out of the fitter's ``parms``, so a
                    ``poi_params`` reorder or the saturated path's
                    ``CompositeParamModel`` (which concatenates submodel names
                    unchanged) is tracked automatically, where the old wall's
                    flat ``x[:nparams]`` indexing had to refuse it.
     the binding |Y|
                    the card's OWN gen |Y| reach (see ``_binding_absY``), not
                    a module constant -- the one number the old wall left
                    "UNDER TEST" at 5.0.

   TWO CONSEQUENCES WORTH STATING. The wall reads the CORRECTION's anchor, so
   a fit run with ``anchor_source=cache`` or ``anchor_override=`` shifts the
   model's map without shifting the wall's; and a lambda HELD out of the fit
   is read at the correction's value, so ``xparam_default=<held lambda>=v``
   pins it somewhere the wall does not know about. Both are loudly logged
   choices in the model, both are rare, and neither is detectable from
   ``indata`` -- so this wall PRINTS every anchor, width and held value it
   resolved at construction. Check that block against the model's own
   "anchor from the theory correction" line before trusting a walled fit.

BLINDING is not an issue. alphaS is blinded ADDITIVELY on the POI slot, but
the lambdas are POUs and rabbit never blinds those (``fitter.get_model_nui``),
so ``get_x()`` hands the wall their true values. The wall never reads the POI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The walls
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read off the SCETlib source the fit actually links -- ``np_effective`` and
``gamma_nu_np_model`` in ``include/scetlib/qT/{NP_models,Gamma_nu}_formulas.hpp``
at b66f8de -- not off the AN's normalised parametrisation. Both NP models are
evaluated at the RAW b_T there (``Gamma_nu.cpp`` passes b* only to the
perturbative logarithm, and this cache has ``b0_over_bmax_global = 0``, which
makes b* the identity on the TMD side), so "for all b_T >= 0" below is the
exact necessary-and-sufficient condition, not a conservative proxy.

The damping criterion is "the tanh argument is >= 0 for all b" (gamma_nu <= 0 /
f^NP decaying), i.e. a polynomial in u = b_T^2 is non-negative on u >= 0:

  CS side   gamma_nu^NP(b) = -lambda_inf_nu * tanh( P(u)/lambda_inf_nu ) ,
            P(u) = lambda2_nu*u + lambda4_nu*u^2 + lambda6_nu*u^3
                                             (lambda6_nu = 0 for tanh_2)
      tanh_2:  lambda_inf_nu > 0 , lambda2_nu >= 0 , lambda4_nu >= 0
      tanh_6:  lambda_inf_nu > 0 , lambda2_nu >= 0 , lambda6_nu >= 0
               (leading), and lambda4_nu >= 0 OR
               lambda4_nu^2 <= 4*lambda2_nu*lambda6_nu (interior; lambda4_nu
               may dip negative while the b^6 term keeps P >= 0)

  TMD side  f^NP(Y,b) = exp(-2*lambda_inf*b*tanh(a)) ,
            a*lambda_inf = b*Q(u) ,  Q(u) = L2 + B*u + lambda6*u^2 ,
            B = lambda4 + L2^3/(3*lambda_inf^2) ,
            L2 = lambda2 + delta_lambda2*Y^2       (lambda6 = 0 for tanh_2)
      tanh_2:  lambda_inf > 0 , L2 >= 0 ,
               B >= 0  [written as 3*lambda_inf^2*lambda4 + L2^3 >= 0]
      tanh_6:  lambda_inf > 0 , L2 >= 0 , lambda6 >= 0 (leading),
               and B >= 0 OR B^2 <= 4*L2*lambda6            (interior)
            evaluated at Y = 0 AND Y = Y_max, which covers delta_lambda2 of
            either sign: L2 is monotonic in Y^2, so the binding |Y| is one of
            the two extremes.

NOTE THE ARCTANH CORRECTION. The TMD cube coefficient is
B = lambda4 + L2^3/(3*lambda_inf^2), NOT lambda4: ``np_effective`` adds
``(1/3)*pow3(lambda2_Y*bT/lambda_inf)`` for tanh_2 as well as tanh_6, which is
the leading arctanh correction that makes tanh(a) reproduce the unsaturated
``identity`` model. Three powers of lambda_inf, as in the source; AN-25-085
Eq. (eq:npf) writes one, which is a typo in the note, not a different
convention (see knowledge/30_physics_global/np_parametrization_constraints.md).
It matters physically here: lambda4 < 0 is NOT by itself unphysical, because
L2^3 can more than pay for it -- at the 2026-09-10 postfit tune
3*lambda4 + L2^3 = +0.019 at Y = 0 and only turns negative near |Y| = 2.5.
Multiplying every condition through by 3*lambda_inf^2 > 0 also keeps them
division-free.

All conditions are the lambda_inf-EXACT forms, and the tanh_2 ones are the
lambda6 -> 0 reduction of the tanh_6 ones (the leading coefficient is then
lambda4_nu / B, hence the simpler >= 0 limit). This file uses the DAMPING
criterion (P >= 0), which lets the interior coefficient dip negative inside the
discriminant bound; ``np_monotonicity.py`` uses the stricter MONOTONICITY
criterion (sqrt(3) in place of sqrt(4)).

Every condition is written uniformly as ``coeff >= bound`` with penalty
``relu2(bound - coeff)``, including the interior discriminants (whose coeff
``4*lambda2_nu*lambda6_nu - relu2(-lambda4_nu)`` is self-gating: it is
positive for lambda4_nu >= 0, so no penalty and no division by lambda6_nu).
That uniformity is what lets :func:`damping_conditions` serve the TF penalty,
the construction-time check on HELD lambdas, and the offline diagnostic from
one definition.

The small-b turn-on walls (lambda2_nu >= 0, L2 >= 0) are stronger than the
large-b limit: they forbid an anti-damping bump near b -> 0, not just the wrong
asymptote. ``smallb=0`` drops them, leaving only the limiting/interior
behaviour and the lambda_inf floors -- then use the postfit sigma(qT) >= 0
check as the real guard.
