# WRemnantsHelpers

Scripts, common recipies, and notes for the WRemnants framework.

We assume you're running in the WRemenants singularity:

```
singularity run --bind /scratch/,/ceph/ /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/gitlab-registry.cern.ch/bendavid/cmswmassdocker/wmassdevrolling\:latest
```

To initialize the environment, 

```
source setup.sh
```

Which relies on the directory structure,

```
WRemnants/
WRemntantsHelpers/
```
