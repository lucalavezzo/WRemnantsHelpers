# AN-25-085 Digest

## Scope
Working high-level physics context from `/home/submit/lavezzo/alphaS/AN-25-085`.

## Canonical Facts
- Main goal: extract `alphaS(mZ)` from Drell-Yan data (2016 post-VFP context).
- Main detector-level extraction uses 4D fit in `(ptll, yll, cosTheta*, phi*)`.
- Framework: profile-likelihood style fits via rabbit and WRemnants ecosystem.
- Theory setup includes SCETlib+DYTurbo high-order corrections with MC reweighting.

## Practical Binning Snapshot
- Z detector level: `40 x 20 x 8 x 8 = 51,200` bins.
- W detector level: `2,880` bins.

## Rules I Should Follow
- Treat AN repository files as physics source of truth.
- Mark explicitly when results are placeholder/blinded/work-in-progress.
- Keep automation aligned with channel correlations and nuisance definitions.

## Caveats
- Analysis note currently contains placeholders in some sections.
- `simFit.tex` remains early-stage/in-progress.
