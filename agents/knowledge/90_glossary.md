# Glossary

- `WREM_BASE`: Canonical WRemnants root selected by `setup.sh`.
- `rabbit`: Fit framework used for setup and likelihood minimization.
- `FoM`: Figure of merit; for this workflow often the scaled total impact on `pdfAlphaS`.
- `4FS`: Four-flavor scheme with explicit massive b treatment.
- `5FS`: Five-flavor scheme with massless b in matrix-element treatment.
- `normalized swap`: Replace selected component with normalization matching to isolate shape effect.
- `unnormalized swap`: Direct selected-component replacement preserving original yields.
